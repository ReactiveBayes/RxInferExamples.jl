    In this notebook, we solve a GP regression problem by using 'Stochastic Differential Equation' (SDE). This method is well described in the dissertation 'Stochastic differential equation methods for spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression.' by Arno Solin and 'Sequential Inference for Latent Temporal Gaussian Process Models' by Jouni Hartikainen.
