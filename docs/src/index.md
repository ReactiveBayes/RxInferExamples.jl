Welcome to the examples gallery for [RxInfer.jl](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/RxInfer.jl), a Julia package for reactive message passing and probabilistic programming.

!!! note
    This documentation is automatically generated from Jupyter notebooks in the repository.
    The examples are regularly tested to ensure they work with the latest version of RxInfer.jl.

## About RxInfer.jl

RxInfer.jl is a Julia package that combines message passing-based inference with reactive programming paradigms. It provides:

- A flexible framework for probabilistic programming
- Reactive message passing for real-time inference
- Efficient and scalable inference algorithms
- Support for both online and offline inference
- Integration with the Julia ecosystem
