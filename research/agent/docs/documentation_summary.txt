DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
------------------
The new generic_agent_interface.md covers:

1. Overview
   - Core concept of composability
   - Interface-driven design

2. Design Philosophy
   - Separation of concerns
   - Compile-time safety, runtime flexibility
   
3. Abstract Interface Pattern
   - Agent interface (5 required methods)
   - Environment interface (4 required methods)
   - Simulation contract

4. Type-Level Composability
   - Type parameter system
   - Dimensional compatibility
   - Generic algorithms

5. Technical Implementation
   - Complete agent implementation pattern
   - Complete environment implementation pattern
   - Step-by-step code examples

6. Usage Patterns
   - Explicit composition
   - Factory-based composition
   - Mix-and-match examples

7. Extension Guide
   - Adding new agents
   - Adding new environments
   - Integration instructions

8. Benefits and Trade-offs
   - Detailed analysis of pros and cons
   - When pattern excels vs. when it's overkill

9. Real-World Examples
   - Same agent, different environments
   - Different agents, same environment
   - Research across dimensions
