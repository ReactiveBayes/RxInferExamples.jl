    "## Motion Planning of Robotic Arm in Joint Space\n",

    "This example demonstrates motion planning for a robotic arm using RxInfer. It's important to understand that the probabilistic inference for motion planning occurs in **joint space** rather than Cartesian space:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Joint Space**: The space of all possible joint angles (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, ...) of the robotic arm. Our inference model directly plans trajectories in this space, finding optimal joint angle sequences and the control torques needed to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cartesian Space**: The 3D space (x, y, z) where the end effector operates. While our targets are specified in Cartesian space, they are translated to joint space targets using inverse kinematics before planning begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "1. It directly models the physical dynamics of the arm's joints\n",
    "2. It respects the arm's natural degrees of freedom\n",
    "3. It allows for more efficient inference in the space where control actually happens\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is:\n",
    "1. Specify target positions in Cartesian space (user-friendly)\n",
    "2. Convert targets to joint angles using inverse kinematics\n",
    "3. Use RxInfer to plan optimal trajectories between joint configurations\n",
    "4. Visualize the resulting motion in Cartesian space using forward kinematics"
