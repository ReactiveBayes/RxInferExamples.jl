    "## What's Missing: Current Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While our LLM-Bayesian integration works, this is very much a proof-of-concept with several important limitations that need to be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Fixed Functional Forms\n",
    "Currently, our LLM nodes are hardcoded to output `Normal` distributions with specific parameter ranges. This isn't very flexible:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Current: Always returns Normal(mean, variance)\n",
    "return NormalMeanVariance(obj[\"mean\"], obj[\"variance\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The issue**: What if we want LLMs to output other distributions? Gamma? Beta? Categorical? Or even mixture distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy extension**: The nodes should be generic and allow the user to specify the desired output distribution family through the task description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Message Products Not Addressed\n",
    "In real factor graphs, you often need to combine multiple incoming messages before processing them. Our current implementation only handles single messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Current: Only handles one message at a time\n",
    "@rule LLMPrior(:b, Marginalisation) (q_c::PointMass{<:String}, q_t::PointMass{<:String})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The issue**: What happens when multiple messages arrive at an LLM node? How do we combine them before sending to the LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing**: Rules for message products and handling multiple incoming probability distributions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Uncertainty Quantification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most philosophically questionable aspect of our approach is how we handle uncertainty. We're essentially asking LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"What do you think about your own confidence?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is arguably unprincipled for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text-to-Text Uncertainty**: When we prompt an LLM to express uncertainty about its own output, we're asking it to introspect about its own reasoning process. But LLMs don't actually have access to their internal uncertainty - they're just generating text that sounds like uncertainty based on their training.\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# This is basically what we're doing:\n",
    "\"I think this text expresses positive sentiment with variance 0.8\"\n",
    "# vs\n",
    "\"I think this text expresses positive sentiment with variance 2.5\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM is pattern-matching to training examples where humans expressed different levels of confidence, but it's not performing genuine uncertainty quantification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log-Probability Limitations**: An alternative approach might be to use the LLM's token log-probabilities as uncertainty proxies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Instead of asking the LLM about uncertainty, use its output probabilities\n",
    "token_probs = model.logprobs(response)\n",
    "uncertainty = -sum(token_probs)  # Entropy-based uncertainty\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is also problematic because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confidence ≠ Correctness**: An LLM can be very confident (high probability) about completely wrong outputs\n",
    "2. **Sequence-level vs Token-level**: High token probabilities don't necessarily mean the overall semantic content is reliable\n",
    "3. **Distribution Mismatch**: Token probabilities reflect linguistic patterns, not epistemic uncertainty about the underlying task\n",
    "4. **Training Artifacts**: LLM confidence is heavily influenced by training data patterns rather than true knowledge uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Do It Anyway**: Despite being unprincipled, this approach can be useful in the absence of other information. When you have no other source of uncertainty quantification, asking an LLM to express its confidence can provide a rough proxy that's better than no uncertainty at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a bit like asking someone \"how sure are you?\" - not perfect, but often practically useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Better Path**: True uncertainty quantification would require:\n",
    "- Explicit modeling of different uncertainty sources (aleatoric vs epistemic)\n",
    "- Integration with proper Bayesian model uncertainty\n",
    "- Integration of subjective logic frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "But for a proof-of-concept showing LLMs can participate in message passing? Text-based uncertainty estimation gets the job done."

    "## Conclusion: The Weird Idea That Worked\n",
    "\n",
    "What started as a lunch conversation about reactive systems turned into a working prototype that treats LLMs as first-class citizens in Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight wasn't just technical—it was philosophical. Instead of trying to make LLMs more like traditional ML models, we asked: what if we make traditional Bayesian inference more like natural reasoning?\n",
    "\n",
    "By hooking LLMs into RxInfer's message passing framework, we've created a bridge between LLMs and Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens a path toward agentic systems grounded in principled uncertainty—where trust networks, capability reasoning, and task coordination all emerge from coherent Bayesian models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the best discoveries happen when you stop overthinking and just try the crazy idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it all started with the realization that RxInfer doesn't care what you pass through those edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you can define the rules, you can pass anything and be reactive about it."

    "### A few caveats about NormalMixture node\n",
    "\n",
    "There few known issues with `NormalMixture` node:\n",
    "- Iterations matter: with VMP, more iterations can materially change posteriors; too many iterations can lead to overconfident or wrong clusters.\n",
    "- Mixture limitation: `NormalMixture` under meanfield tends to collapse to a single Normal on its output edge, losing multi‑modality and corrupting downstream beliefs.\n",
    "- Prefer gating/mixtures: use a gating/expert setup (`rSLDS`‑style see [rSLDS.jl](https://examples.rxinfer.com/categories/experimental_examples/recurrent_switching_linear_dynamical_system/)) that propagates the full mixture (preserve z–y dependence) instead of moment‑matching to one Normal.\n",
    "- If keeping this model: increase iterations and use stronger priors/initialization; but for robust results, favor gating or explicit mixture propagation."
